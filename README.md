## Introduction

**gallvp/prepngs** is a bioinformatics pipeline that pre-processes NGS data for downstream reuse across various pipelines.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Raw read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Adapter trimming ([`FASTP`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp))
3. Trimmed read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
4. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run gallvp/prepngs \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
